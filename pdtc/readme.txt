Bruna et al, Cell 2016 PDTX data v1.1 14th September 2016.
This repository contains summarised data and plots from the Caldas Lab PDTX cohort described in the paper Bruna et al, Cell 2016. Note that these data is updated with new models/new analysis, therefore there might be slight differences with the paper.

Scripts:
Please note that the scripts are included for illustrative purposes only, and they might need tweaking (directory names, etc) to make them run as they are.
